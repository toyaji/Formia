# Formia Development Guide

This skill ensures that the agent follows the project-specific rules, architecture, and design philosophy of Formia.

## Instructions

1.  **Always read `docs/`**: Before performing any code modification or design work, re-read the relevant documentation in the `docs/` folder to ensure compliance with the "Form Factor" schema and "Araform" design system.
2.  **Follow `.agent/rules.md`**: This file contains the primary directives for the project.
3.  **UI/UX Compliance**: Ensure every UI change follows the tokens defined in `docs/design_tokens.md` and the philosophy in `docs/ui_ux_design.md`.

## Workflow

If you are unsure of the next step, refer to the `implementation_plan.md` in the agent's brain directory.
