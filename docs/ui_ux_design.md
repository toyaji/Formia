# UI/UX Design: Formia

## 1. Design Philosophy

Formia should feel **Premium, Alive, and Effortless**, inspired by modern, clean web services like **Araform**.

- **Modern & Clean**: Minimalist aesthetics that prioritize content and ease of use.
- **Premium**: Avoid "standard" UI looks. Use high-quality typography, subtle shadows, and intentional whitespace.
- **Alive**: Every interaction should have a micro-animation. Hover states, active states, and AI-driven updates should feel fluid.
- **Effortless**: The AI should do the "heavy lifting".

## 2. Color Palette & Typography

- **Primary**: Deep Blue / Purple gradients (`#4F46E5` to `#7C3AED`).
- **Surface**: Glassmorphic backgrounds with variable blur.
- **Typography**: Modern Sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Montserrat).

## 3. The AI Agent Sidebar

- Located on the right or left (configurable).
- Needs to feel like a "colleague".
- Visual indicators of "Thinking" and "Applying Changes".

## 4. Interaction Patterns

- **AI Highlight**: When the AI suggests a change, the corresponding part of the form should glow or animate.
- **Drafting Mode**: AI changes are shown as drafts before being committed.
