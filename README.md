# Formia: AI-Agentic Form Builder

Formia is a next-generation form builder designed for the AI era. While traditional builders like TypeForm or Google Forms rely on manual drag-and-drop interfaces, Formia leverages an integrated AI agent to help users build complex, high-conversion forms through natural conversation and intelligent automation.

## 🚀 Key Vision

The core of Formia is the **AI Agent Side Panel**. Imagine building a form not by clicking buttons, but by chatting with an agent that understands your business goals.

- **Natural Language Construction**: "Create a lead generation form for a pet grooming service with a playful tone."
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: "Based on your goal, I suggest adding a 'Preferred Grooming Time' field with multiple-choice options."
- **Dynamic Styling**: "Make this form look like a modern KakaoTalk interface."
- **Logic & Branching**: The AI handles complex conditional logic setup based on your description.

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Proposed)

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS with modern design tokens (Glassmorphism, rich gradients)
- **AI Integration**: Custom Agent Interface (similar to Antigravity)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma/Supabase
- **Deployment**: Vercel/AWS
